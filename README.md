Get ready to Tic. Get ready to Tac. Get ready to Tic-Tac-Toe! Here it comes! A gorgeously neon green-ish Tic-Tac-Toe board ready to be hacked. 

All you have to do is download the file, open it up in your browser, and then yo....wait a minute. The code doesn't work! What the... Swiper has swiped our code! (Say it with me now: "Swiper, no swiping!") We'll forgive him and get it fixed it up to make the game work. Will you help me put it back together?
